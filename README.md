Assignment criteria
- The greatest common divisor of integers x and y is the largest integer that evenly divides both x and y. Write a recursive function gcd that returns the greatest common divisor of x and y. The greatest common divisor of x and y is defined recursively as follows: If y is equal to 0, then gcd(x, y) is x; otherwise gcd(x, y) is gcd(y, x % y), where % is the remainder operator.
